## my practice

i am a designer and sustainability researcher based in ho chi minh city, vietnam.

my practice investigates means of inserting crafted control into digital, automated and industrial textile and garment production technologies and systems, and in subverting traditional practices with new processes and materials. through surface design interventions and material provocations, my practice confronts chaotic material and making conditions in the decorative space of creative embellishment. rejecting anachronistic ideas around material purity and craft authenticity, my practice seeks to innovate around sustainability by looking to the idiosyncratic complexities of contemporary life.

> The communal alternative does not provide the gregarious confidence of the political hooligan or the empty pride of the racist. Belonging to a community is recognition through work and learning, not an ‘essence’ inherited from national culture or birth, or the result of insubstantial adherence or an ID card. It’s no the product of of the permanent imagination of confrontation with some universal evil. You are building constantly with others, making things so we can all grow together, sharing more and more responsibility, and giving and receiving trust. It’s the opposite of the impunity that ‘frees’ the ‘follower’ who is protected by a leader, a flag, or a political brand in the din of street fighting, online bickering, or media ‘smackdowns.’ To be a communard is to gain autonomy and security in the fraternity of learning, to be rediscovered as valuable and valued in shared work. To be a communard is to put the values we believe in into action, not compete to shout them the loudest or wield them like a menacing weapon. To be a communard does not give the static tranquility of the yogi or the mystic who seeks the silence of loneliness, but the serenity that listens to and seeks to include others, without using outrage as an excuse to do nothing or hiding behind the disdain of supposed superiority. To be a communard is a way of living, learning, and building by sharing it all with others
