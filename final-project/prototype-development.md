# prototype development

### concept and key elements

the final project puts forward a design methodology for **upcycled**, **zero waste** garments. **surface design** is **synthesised** **with garment construction**, meaning that seams and cuts into each garment panel will be delineated \(thus fray-checked\) using **digital embroidery** and will be stitched out at the same time as the decorative elements of each piece. decorative elements are generative based on natural growth patterns and respond to the uncut garment panel shapes. the design methodology is grounded in digital design and fabrication, however this is a hybrid process. garment construction and embellishment assembly will be completed by hand using a packing needle, silk tapes and embroidery with dyed silk thread.

{% hint style="info" %}
**a note on thread**

thread is measured by weight. the standard thread weight for digital embroidery is 40wt. 40wt means that 1kg of thread will be 40kms in length. therefore a 30wt thread is heavier, though its name may appear to suggest otherwise.

most digitised designs are for 40wt thread. if a 30wt thread must be used the stitch density must be increased by around 1/3, alternatively the scale of the design can be increased by up to 125%, or the stitch length can be increased. thread weight dictates needle size -- the needle should be 40% larger than the diameter of the thread. so, for a 40wt thread we would use a \#90/14 needle, for a 30wt thread we would use 100/10.
