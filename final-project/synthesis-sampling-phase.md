### thread

thread is measured by weight. the standard thread weight for digital embroidery is 40wt. 40wt means that 1kg of thread will be 40kms in length. therefore a 30wt thread is heavier, though its name may deceptively suggest otherwise.

most digitised designs are for 40wt thread. if a 30wt thread must be used the stitch density must be increased by around 1/3, alternatively the scale of the design can be increased by up to 125%, or the stitch length can be increased. thread weight dictates needle size -- the needle should be 40% larger than the diameter of the thread. so, for a 40wt thread we would use a \#90/14 needle, for a 30wt thread we would use 100/10.
