# open source circular fashion

## fashion: a homogeneity producing system

ours is a culture with 'no running room'

> “we experience an almost seamless circuit of production and consumption”...a ‘hyper aesthetic scenario.. in which design is a fundamental agent of capitalism and globalisation” \[our\] reality \[is\] increasingly an aesthetic construct’ \(Mazanti, 2011, p70\)

the financialisation of fashion has transformed it from a niche field of applied art and a unique means to creative expression and individuation into a global industry characterised by extreme, chaotic excess. 

the superabundance of what Goldmith \(2014\) terms "faux-choix" sees that we acquire more and more of the same. we consume polyester of a single repeating cell and cotton of a single biological strand in shapes that reflect and conform to one another. It appears we cannot stop, continually duped by the changeless change of the fashion industry and the promise that we may be more than we are. 

> ‘The freedom of identity-seekers is akin to that of a bicycle rider; the penalty for ceasing to pedal is a fall, and one has to go on pedaling just to retain the upright posture. The necessity for keeping on toiling is a plight without choice since the alternative is too awesome to contemplate’

## retain the upright posture, but stop pedaling

fuad-luke \( defines the maker movement as an active fight against planned obsolence.  

zero waste garment construction. 

## crafting alternatives

we are asphyxiating. 

i am looking at the lungs. 

initial inspiration : respiration - the lungs. epithelia as lace. intricacy.  chaos is an ocean of broken links. alternative networks help us to breathe, to re-link, re-form, recontextualise. 

 looked at medical slides of human lung tissue.

on considering seamless joins in the context of garment construction, i drew inspiration from how epithelial tissue joins, in particular the type of joins called 'tight junctions'

![types of junctions in epithelial cells](.gitbook/assets/tight-junction.jpg)

> "a tight junction is a relatively impenetrable attachment between two epithelial cells formed by membrane proteins that interlock somewhat like a zipper"
